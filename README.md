## Description

A simple executable that emulates a mouse scroll wheel's up and down movements, via Shift + Up and Down arrow keys.


## Install & Usage

Download and run the EXE from the location of your choice. It's possible you'll have to right click the EXE file and tell it to run as admin.

Once the program is running, while you're holding Shift, use the Up and Down arrow keys on your keyboard. It'll behave as if you're pressing the scroll wheel.


## Releases

While you can feel free to compile the EXE yourself, all my releases will be posted on Nexus mods.
